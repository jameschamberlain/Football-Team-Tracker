Football-Team-Tracker
===================================

An Android app for tracking your football team. I developed this to help keep track of my 6-a-side football team. It works with any size team. Its features include:
-Fixture tracking (date, time, opponent, goalscorers, assists)
-Player tracking (goals and assists)
-Team stats summary (visual representation of wins, losses and draws as well as goals for and against summaries)
